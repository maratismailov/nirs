[1] Measurements at ∼400 campaign‐style GPS points
and another 14 continuously recording stations in central Asia define variations in their velocities both along
and across the Kyrgyz and neighboring parts of
Tien Shan. They show that at the longitude of Kyrgyzstan the Tarim Basin converges with Eurasia at
20 ± 2 mm/yr, nearly two thirds of the total convergence rate between India and Eurasia at this longitude.
This high rate suggests that the Tien Shan has grown
into a major mountain range only late in the evolution
of the India‐Eurasia collision. Most of the convergence
between Tarim and Eurasia within the upper crust of
the Tien Shan presumably occurs by slip on faults on
the edges of and within the belt, but 1–3 mm/yr of convergence is absorbed farther north, at the Dzungarian
Alatau and at a lower rate with the Kazakh platform
to the west. The Tarim Basin is thrust beneath the Tien
Shan at ∼4–7 mm/yr. With respect to Eurasia, the Ferghana Valley rotates counterclockwise at ∼0.7° Myr−1
about an axis at the southwest end of the valley. Thus,
GPS data place a bound of ∼4 mm/yr on the rate of crustal shortening across the Chatkal and neighboring ranges

on the northwest margin of the Ferghana Valley, and
they limit the present‐day slip rate on the right‐lateral
Talas‐Ferghana fault to less than ∼2 mm/yr. GPS measurements corroborate geologic evidence indicating
that the northern margin of the Pamir overthrusts the
Alay Valley and require a rate of at least 10 and possibly 15 mm/yr. Citation: Zubovich, A. V., et al. (2010),

1. Introduction
[2] Whereas slip on a single fault at a boundary between
oceanic plates accommodates virtually all relative motion
between the adjacent plates, intracontinental deformation
commonly occurs by widespread deformation and slip on
numerous faults. This form of deformation is particularly
apparent where mountain ranges have been built in intracontinental settings, such as that in which the Rocky
Mountains of the western United States developed in late
Cretaceous and early Cenozoic (Laramide) time.
[3] The Tien Shan serves as the prototypical active
intracontinental mountain belt. Separate ranges, bounded on
one or both sides by reverse faults and with intermontane
basins between them, collectively form a belt of widespread
deformation and abundant seismicity far from boundaries of
the major plates (Figure 1). Such belts typify active deformation elsewhere in Asia, such as in Mongolia or on the
northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, and they characterize the separate ranges that form the Andes in parts of
Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, and Argentina. In active intracontinental belts, several faults are concurrently active; no
single fault defines a plate boundary. Lateral continuity of
individual ranges, however, can be short, only 100–200 km,
and slip rates on faults within the belts vary along strike.
[4] The Tien Shan illustrates these features. Both field
observations of active faulting [e.g., Abdrakhmatov et al.,
2007; Chedia, 1986; Laverov and Makarov, 2005;
Makarov, 1977; Makarov et al., 2010; Sadybakasov, 1990;
Shultz, 1948; Thompson et al., 2002] and fault plane solutions
of moderate earthquakes [e.g., Ghose et al., 1998; Maggi et
al., 2000; Nelson et al., 1987; Tapponnier and Molnar,
1979] demonstrate largely reverse faulting, in some cases
with modest but not negligible strike‐slip components. Four
earthquakes with magnitudes greater than approximately
8 have occurred within the Tien Shan since 1889 [e.g.,

Kondorskaya and Shebalin, 1977; Gu et al., 1989; Molnar
and Ghose, 2000; Richter, 1958; Savarenskii et al., 1962].
Studies of Quaternary faulting demonstrate slip at rates of 1
to 4 mm/yr on several approximately parallel faults that
divide the belt into blocks tens of kilometers in width [e.g.,
Abdrakhmatov et al., 2007; Makarov, 1977; Thompson et
al., 2002]. Deep basins with 2000 m or more of late Cenozoic sediment lie between ranges [e.g., Cobbold et al.,
1996; Laverov and Makarov, 2005; Makarov, 1977;
Sadybakasov, 1990]. East‐west dimensions of such basins
and of the ranges between them, however, are only ∼100–

300 km (Figures 1, 2, and 3). Accordingly, despite the linearity of the belt as a whole, along‐strike variations within it
make finding a typical cross section difficult [e.g., Laverov
and Makarov, 2005; Makarov, 1977; Sadybakasov, 1990].
Moreover, the deep structure of the belt, as reflected in both
crustal thickness [e.g., Kosarev et al., 1993; Oreshin et al.,
2002; Vinnik et al., 2002] and upper mantle structure [e.g.,
Li et al., 2009; Roecker et al., 1993; Wolfe and Vernon, 1998],
shows marked differences both across and along the strike of
the range.

Figures 4, 5, 7, and 9, and regions where smaller maps are shown. The region labeled 1 is shown in
Figure 6, and that labeled 2 is in Figure 8.
[5] To the south of the Tien Shan, the Tarim Basin
(Figures 1–3) appears to deform sufficiently slowly that its
movement relative to Eurasia has been described as a rigid
body rotation about an axis just south of the southeastern
edge of the basin [e.g., Calais et al., 2006; England and
Molnar, 2005; Kuzikov and Mukhamediev, 2010; Meade,
2007; Reigber et al., 2001; Shen et al., 2001; Thatcher,
2007]. In most such treatments, root‐mean‐square (RMS)
differences in relative velocities among points in the basin
are less than 2 mm/yr, and as small as 1 mm/yr for some
studies.
[6] At the western end of the Tien Shan, the Ferghana
Valley (Figures 1–3) also seems to undergo only mild de-

formation except on its edges [e.g., Reigber et al., 2001;
Thomas et al., 1993; Ulomov, 1974]. Mountain ranges to the
north of the Ferghana Valley, including the Chatkal Range,
and to its south, the South Tien Shan, absorb relative
movement of the basin with respect to the regions on its
flanks. Seismicity on the edge of the valley is relatively
high, but only sparse small earthquakes have been located
beneath its center (Figure 1). Sediment has accumulated
within the valley since at least Mesozoic time, and high
terrain seems to have surrounded the region for much of that
time [e.g., Kreydenkov and Raspopin, 1972; Kuzichkina,
1972; Sinitsyn, 1960, pp. 101–109; Sinitsyn, 1962]. Paleomagnetic declination anomalies suggest as much as 20°–30°
of counterclockwise rotation of the basin and the neigh-

boring Chatkal Range with respect to Eurasia [Bazhenov,
1993; Thomas et al., 1993]. Thus, the Ferghana Valley
seems to have maintained its identity as a block since Mesozoic time.
[7] To the west of the Tarim Basin and south of the South
Tien Shan, the Pamir shares features that typify the Tibetan
Plateau: a high, relatively flat plateau (Figures 2 and 3),
where normal faulting and east‐west extension appear to
dominate active deformation [e.g., Burtman and Molnar,
1993; Strecker et al., 1995]. Many of the same east‐west
trending sutures and fragments of Gondwana that had been
accreted to Eurasia during Phanerozoic time can be identified in the Pamir and in the Hindu Kush of Afghanistan
farther west, and it follows that the regions have undergone
a similar geologic history, at least perhaps until the Pamir

was displaced northward with respect to most of Tibet,
presumably in Cenozoic time [e.g., Burtman and Molnar,
1993; Schwab et al., 2004]. Both the Pamir and Hindu
Kush are associated with intermediate‐depth seismicity,
whose form suggests the presence of a deformed, subducted
lithospheric slab at depth [e.g., Mellors et al., 1995; Pavlis
and Das, 2000; Roecker, 1982; Vinnik et al., 1977]. The
inclined zone of seismicity projects to the surface at northern
edge of the Pamir, where concentrated shortening occurs
along the Pamir frontal thrust zone, suggesting subduction
of continental lithosphere beneath the Pamir [Burtman and
Molnar, 1993; Hamburger et al., 1992; Strecker et al.,
2003].
[8] We present observations of present‐day surface
motions within and around the Tien Shan based on 16 years of

TC6014

geodetic measurements from a dense, regional GPS network
(Figures 2 and 3). These data provide quantitative constraints
on deformation rates within and around the Tien Shan and in
turn within this type area of intracontinental mountain
building. A few points for which we can obtain GPS velocities lie within the Pamir, and they allow us to address deformation on its eastern and northern edges.

2. GPS Network and Processing
[9] We report results from campaign measurements beginning in 1994 and from a growing number of continuously recording stations in the region since before 1994. In
fact, the GPS network that we analyze began as three separate networks each of which grew over time (we give a
summary of the history of these networks in the auxiliary
material).1 Table 1 summarizes not only velocities and
uncertainties of GPS points, but also dates of the first
campaigns used in our determination of the velocity field,
durations spanned by remeasurements, and numbers of
remeasurement campaigns for each site. Table 1 updates
results for subsets of these data analyzed earlier
[Abdrakhmatov et al., 1996; Bogomolov et al., 2007; Bragin
et al., 2001; Herring et al., 2002; Kuzikov and Mukhamediev,
2010; Laverov and Makarov, 2005; Meade and Hager, 2001;
Reigber et al., 2001; Yang et al., 2008; Zubovich et al., 2007].
[10] We processed the GPS observations using the
GAMIT/GLOBK software suite [Herring, 2004; King and
Bock, 2004], and we estimated uncertainties following
standard procedures described by Reilinger et al. [2006].
Appendix A gives some details of the processing.

3. Results
[11] To present the velocity field we rely on both maps
(Figures 3, 6, and 8) and profiles (Figures 4, 5, 7, and 9). We
orient profiles perpendicular to the main structures, and plot
separately components of velocity parallel and perpendicular to the structures, which allows convergent or divergent
and strike‐slip components to be separated.
3.1. Convergence Between the Tarim Basin and
Eurasia
[12] Perhaps the most definitive result is the demonstration that the Tarim Basin moves toward the Kazakh Platform, and hence toward the Eurasian plate, at 20 (±2) mm/yr.
Earlier, Abdrakhmatov et al. [1996] had inferred such a rate
by extrapolating measurements within the Kyrgyz and Kazakh side of the Tien Shan to the Tarim Basin in China.
With GPS data from the Tarim Basin, Reigber et al. [2001]
reported a rate of 19 ± 3 mm/yr for a station in the western
Tarim Basin with respect to Eurasia. With more sites in both
Tarim and especially within the stable Kazakh Platform,
with more measurements at individual sites, and with a time
interval spanned by initial and most recent measurements
roughly twice that used by Reigber et al. [2001], we can
refine the rate, as shown most clearly on profiles A‐A′ and

TC6014

B‐B′ (Figures 2 and 4). The lower rates shown for profiles C‐C′ and D‐D′ (Figures 2 and 4) derive in part from
the southernmost points on these profiles lying within the
deforming southern margin of the Tien Shan. Hence the
velocities of these points with respect to Eurasia underestimate the convergence rate between Tarim and Eurasia.
[13] As noted above, GPS data from the entire Tarim
Basin, including a large area east of where we have data,
show that relative to Eurasia Tarim rotates about an axis just
south of the eastern end of the basin [e.g., Calais et al.,
2006; England and Molnar, 2005; Kuzikov and
Mukhamediev, 2010; Meade, 2007; Reigber et al., 2001;
Shen et al., 2001; Thatcher, 2007]. Thus, these angular
velocities require an eastward decrease of convergence rates
of points in Tarim relative to Eurasia, as is apparent also for
data along profile E‐E′ (Figures 2 and 5, blue and green
points). These data, from the western part of Tarim, alone are
inadequate to improve estimates of angular velocities of
Tarim relative to Eurasia, but note that the eastward decrease
in rates also contributes to the smaller maximum rates on
profiles C‐C′ and D‐D′ than on profiles A‐A′ and B‐B′
(Figure 4).
[14] At the longitude of the Kyrgyz, or central, Tien Shan
(∼75°E–80°E), global GPS data show that India converges
with Eurasia at ∼33 mm/yr [Argus et al., 2010]. Thus, in this
segment, shortening across the Tien Shan, by convergence
between the Tarim Basin and the Kazakh Platform, absorbs
nearly two thirds of India’s penetration into Eurasia. Although India seems to underthrust southwestern Tibet at
∼20 mm/yr [e.g., Jade et al., 2004], the orientation of the
Himalaya at this longitude is not perpendicular to the
orientation of plate convergence. Thus underthrusting beneath the western Himalaya absorbs only ∼12–13 mm/yr of
India’s convergence with Eurasia at this longitude.
[15] Estimated amounts of Cenozoic shortening across the
central Tien Shan do not permit shortening at an average
rate of ∼20 mm/yr for more than ∼10 Myr, and hence suggest a much shorter duration than India has been penetrating
into Eurasia (since ∼45–55 Ma [e.g., Garzanti and Van
Haver, 1988; Zhu et al., 2005]). For instance, assuming
Airy isostasy and a Cenozoic age of present‐day elevations,
Avouac et al. [1993] inferred as much as ∼220 km of
shortening. With present‐day knowledge of crustal thickness, however, this amount seems excessive. Using receiver
functions from numerous seismograph stations, Oreshin et
al. [2002] and Vinnik et al. [2002] reported crustal thicknesses of 55–65 km beneath much of the central Tien Shan,
compared with ∼45 km not only beneath the Kazakh Platform to the north and the Tarim Basin to the south, but also
beneath the Naryn Basin within the Tien Shan. Makarov et al.
[2010] inferred similar crustal thicknesses from seismic reflection profiling. Even if one allowed for 20 km of excess
crustal thickness beneath a region as wide as 200 km, if that
thickening were due to shortening of crust 45 km thick, it
would call for only ∼90 km of shortening. From mapping of
structures, Abdrakhmatov et al. [2001], inferred as little as
35–80 km of shortening across central Tien Shan in Kyrgyzstan, which constitutes roughly two thirds of the width of
the belt. Similarly, both Chedia [1986] and Makarov [1995]
[see also Laverov and Makarov, 2005] calculated that 50 km

Continuously recording site.

of shortening suffices to account for the Cenozoic structure
of the Kyrgyz Tien Shan. Heermance et al. [2008] offered a
minimum bound of 10 to 32 km of shortening on the south
side of the range. If between 100 and 200 km of crustal
shortening occurred within the Kyrgyz and Chinese Tien
Shan, then at the current rate, the entire range would have
been built in only 5 to 10 Myr.
[16] The rapid shortening today corroborates other inferences of a recent acceleration of deformation within the Tien
Shan long after India collided with Eurasia [e.g.,
Abdrakhmatov et al., 1996, 2001]. Abrupt increases in
sedimentation in basins both within the Tien Shan and on its
margins are commonly interpreted as evidence for the
emergence of high terrain near or since ∼10 Ma [e.g.,
Abdrakhmatov et al., 2001; Bullen et al., 2001; Charreau et
al., 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009; Ji et al., 2008; Makarov, 1977;
Shultz, 1948; Sun and Zhang, 2009; Sun et al., 2004, 2009;
Trifonov et al., 2008]. Rapid cooling of rock within the
Kyrgyz Range beginning near 11 Ma also suggests an
abrupt increase in exhumation rates at that time [Bullen et
al., 2003; Sobel and Dumitru, 1997; Sobel et al., 2006a].
Neither this evidence, however, nor the present‐day high
convergence rate requires that the Tien Shan formed in late
Cenozoic time. Mountain building deformation of the crust
of the Tien Shan started near the end of the Oligocene or the
beginning of the Miocene Epoch [Chedia, 1986; Makarov,
1977; Shultz, 1948; Sinitsyn, 1962]. Similarly, dating of
deformation on the south side of the Tien Shan demonstrates
active faulting beginning at 20–25 Ma [Heermance et al.,
2008; Yin et al., 1998], an inference consistent with both
cooling ages near 25 Ma [Hendrix et al., 1994; Sobel and
Dumitru, 1997; Sobel et al., 2006b] and changes in sedimentation rates in basins flanking the Tien Shan [e.g.,
Charreau et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2006, 2010; Ji et al.,
2008]. Thus, an acceleration of convergence across the
Tien Shan beginning at or since ∼10 Ma seems to be required, but we cannot distinguish a continuously increasing
rate from an abrupt change near or since ∼10 Ma and a
constant rate since that time.
3.2. Deformation Within the Tien Shan
[17] As is clear both on maps of velocities (Figures 3 and 6)
and on profiles of components of velocity (Figure 4),

components perpendicular to the Tien Shan show a monotonically decreasing rate across the belt, from Tarim to the
southern part of the Kazakh Platform. The velocity gradient
is steepest at distances between ∼400 and ∼700 km for
profiles A‐A′ to D‐D′ in Figures 2 and 4. In an analysis of
active faulting in the area crossed by profile A‐A′ (Figures 2
and 4a), Makarov [1977] [see also Makarov et al., 2010] not
only reported active faults on the edge of the Tien Shan, but
they also described active faulting within the belt. Later,
Thompson et al. [2002] and Abdrakhmatov et al. [2007]
discussed four such faults within the high terrain of the
range slipping at ∼1 mm/yr or more, and other more minor
faults. In a profile of GPS velocities across this region, they
showed steep gradients and high strain rates where they had
mapped active faults. Moreover, the differences in velocity
across these steep gradients matched (with allowance for
uncertainties) the slip rates that they had determined for the
faults. Our profile A‐A′ shows a difference of 8–10 mm/yr
across the southern margin of the Tien Shan between 300
and 350 km on the profile (Figure 2), where Scharer et al.
[2004] had inferred a Quaternary rate of ∼5 to 7.8 mm/yr,
a second difference of 3–4 mm/yr across the Naryn Basin
(near 500 km) and near where Thompson et al. [2002] had
inferred slip at ∼4 mm/yr by dating warped terraces and offsets on faults, and hints of smaller differences of 1–2 mm/yr
across steep gradients farther north near 600 and 650 km,
again near faults that they had mapped. Moreover, as is
clearer farther east on profiles C‐C′ and D‐D′ (Figures 4c and
4d), GPS points just north of the Kyrgyz Range move
northward at 1–2 mm/yr with respect to the Kazakh Platform
and Eurasia. Some shortening seems to occur not only within
the Dzungarian Alatau (the high terrain between 44.5°N and
45.5°N on the eastern margin of Figure 6) and its westward
continuation, but also north of it within the Kazakh Platform
(Figures 2–4).
[18] Indications of steep gradients in the velocity field are
also present along profile B‐B′ (Figures 2 and 4b) at three
places: (1) a difference of ∼5 mm/yr between ∼300 and
450 km, north of the southern edge of the Tien Shan and
north of or within the fold‐and‐thrust belt that bounds the
belt; (2) another of ∼5–6 mm/yr near 600 km, within the
Tien Shan between the southern and northern edges of
Issyk‐Kul and the large basin that it occupies; and (3) a hint

indicate movement to the right of the profile and hence approximately southward movement relative to
Eurasia. Error bars give 1s uncertainties. Black diamonds and blue upward pointing triangles show rates

of a steep gradient with a difference of ∼2 mm/yr near
700 km across the northern edge of the Tien Shan, where it
bounds the southern edge of the Ili Basin (Figure 6). There
is evidence for shortening between the Ili Basin and the
Kazakh Platform, with 3–5 mm/yr of shortening across the
westward continuation of the Dzungarian Alatau (Figure 6).
[19] Indications of steep gradients suggestive of faults like
those inferred by Thompson et al. [2002] are present on
profile C‐C′ (Figures 2 and 4c) again in three places: (1) a
difference of ∼4 mm/yr between 500 and 550 km, north of
the southern edge of the Tien Shan and north of the fold‐
and‐thrust belt that bounds the belt; (2) another steep gradient with a difference of ∼4 mm/yr near 650 km, within the
Tien Shan, just east of Issyk‐Kul and the large basin that it
occupies; and (3) the suggestion of steep gradient with a
small difference of ∼2 mm/yr near 750 km across the
northern edge of the Tien Shan, where it bounds the southern
edge of the Ili Basin (Figures 4c and 6). Points at the western
end of the Ili Basin move 2–3 mm/yr with respect to Eurasia.
[20] With only sparse data, steep velocity gradients can be
inferred for profile D‐D′ (Figures 2 and 4d), but they cannot

be defined as well as on profiles A‐A′, B‐B′, and C‐C′.
Several points in the Ili Basin, however, move northward
with respect to Eurasia at ∼2–3 mm/yr, and that movement
is absorbed, at least partly, by shortening across the Dzungarian Alatau.
3.3. Strike‐Parallel Deformation Within the Tien Shan
[21] Convergence of the Tarim Basin toward the Kazakh
Platform is clearly oblique to the strike of the Tien Shan,
and accordingly there is a left‐lateral strike‐slip component
of movement parallel to the belt (Figures 3, 4, and 6). Because
inferred axes of rotation of the Tarim Basin with respect to
Eurasia lie south of the southeastern end of the Tarim Basin
[Calais et al., 2006; England and Molnar, 2005; Meade,
2007; Reigber et al., 2001; Shen et al., 2001; Thatcher,
2007] and therefore only 1000–1500 km from the Kyrgyz
Tien Shan, directions of relative movement vary measurably
over short distances (Figure 6). Points just south of the Tien
Shan along profile D‐D′ move with a left‐lateral component
of ∼4 mm/yr with respect to Eurasia, but points farther west

along profile B‐B′ move with a left‐lateral component of
only ∼2 mm/yr (Figures 4 and 6). The left‐lateral component
on profile D‐D′ seems to be absorbed by shear in two zones,
one (between 400 and 600 km) within the Tien Shan, and
the other (near 800 km) at the edge of the Tien Shan and Ili
Basin (Figures 2, 3, and 4d). On profile C‐C′, the left‐lateral
component seems to be absorbed by more localized shear
than data on profile D‐D′ can resolve and again in two
zones, one near the southern edge of the Issyk‐Kul Basin,
and the other at the edge of the Tien Shan and Ili Basin
(Figures 3 and 4c). Localized shear zones are less clearly
defined on profiles A‐A′ and B‐B′, in part because the

component of left‐lateral shear along the Tien Shan is
smaller there.
[22] The west to east increase in the left‐lateral strike‐slip
component along the Tien Shan requires greater eastward
components of velocity at sites in the eastern part of the Tien
Shan than in the western part (Figures 3, 4, and 6). In the
west, velocities are nearly parallel to profile A‐A′, but for
profile D‐D′ in the east, they show clear eastward components. Thus, there might be a small ENE–WSW component
of extension along and within the Tien Shan, despite the
dominance of thrust faulting shown by fault plane solutions
of nearly all earthquakes in the region [e.g., Ghose et al.,

Figure 7. Profile of components of velocity across the Pamir, parts of Ferghana Valley and Tien Shan,
and regions farther north relative to Eurasia (profile F‐F′ in Figure 2). Components perpendicular to the
Alay Valley and Trans‐Alay Range (and parallel to the profile) are shown with red squares and black
diamonds, and components parallel to them (and perpendicular to profiles) are shown with blue and green
triangles. Positive values show convergent (approximately northward) components, or movement to the
right (approximately eastward). Error bars give 1s uncertainties. Black squares and blue upward pointing
triangles show rates of points that lie within 75 km to the west, and red squares and green downward
pointing triangles show points within 75 km to the east of profile F‐F′ in Figure 2. Thrust fault symbols
are shown where active thrust faults have been mapped by Arrowsmith and Strecker [1999], inferred from
seismicity [e.g., Burtman and Molnar, 1993], or from sharp breaks in the topography, and the position of
the Talas‐Ferghana strike‐slip fault is inferred from its obvious expression in the topography.
1998; Maggi et al., 2000; Nelson et al., 1987; Tapponnier
and Molnar, 1979] and by the absence of evidence of normal faulting. We presume that any extensional component
of strain is accommodated by strike‐slip faulting or shear on
planes oriented obliquely to the belt.
3.4. The Pamir and Shortening Across the Alay Valley
[23] The network of GPS sites that we analyzed includes
several sites in the northern part of the Pamir (Figures 2 and
3). Maximum north‐northwestward components of velocity
relative to Eurasia exceed those from the Tarim Basin
(Figures 2 and 4). This difference in velocity would be
consistent with a small component of right‐lateral shear
across the eastern part of the Pamir, where right‐lateral
faults have been mapped [e.g., Cowgill, 2010; Peive et al.,
1964; Ruzhentsev, 1963]. Such right‐lateral shear might be
present, but when south–southeastward components of ve-

locity are plotted on an east–northeast profile from the Pamir
to the Tarim Basin (blue and green points on profile E‐E′;
Figure 5), no obvious step in rates is seen. Rather this
component of velocity increases smoothly from east to west.
Because the strike‐slip component, which clearly exists in
the southern Pamir, dies out to the north, it is possible that
the GPS sites within the Pamir lie too far to the north to
measure a strike‐slip component.
[24] By contrast, east–northeastward components of velocity increase eastward, with a difference of 5–8 mm/yr
between those within the Pamir and within the Tarim Basin
(near 300 km on profile E‐E′; Figure 5). Hence, the interior
of the Pamir diverges from the Tarim Basin, despite the
presence of folds and thrust faults along their boundary [e.g.,
Jin et al., 2003]. This divergence attests to both east‐west
extension within the Pamir, a result consistent with fault plane
solutions of earthquakes [e.g., Burtman and Molnar, 1993;

17 of 23

TC6014

ZUBOVICH ET AL.: GPS VELOCITY FIELD FOR THE TIEN SHAN

Strecker et al., 1995], with the presence of grabens along the
eastern part of the Pamir [e.g., Cowgill, 2010; Tapponnier
and Molnar, 1979], and with velocities of a few continuous
GPS sites in the Pamir and surroundings [Mohadjer et al.,
2010]. The folding of Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary
rock along the western edge of the Tarim Basin implies
convergence perpendicular to the eastern margin of the Pamir
[e.g., Jin et al., 2003], but at present this convergence must be
slow compared with the rate of divergence across a wider belt
(Figure 5). We are unaware of evidence that constrains either
when the divergence began or when convergence on the
eastern margin occurred most rapidly.
[25] Because of the paucity of GPS sites within the Pamir,
its deformation field cannot be quantified in full. Nevertheless, as shown by profile F‐F′ (Figures 2 and 7), rates
relative to Eurasia decrease by at least 10 and possibly by 15
mm/yr over a short distance that spans the Trans‐Alay
Range (near 250 km; Figure 7), which marks the northern
margin of the Pamir, and the Alay Valley just to its north.
Although the rotation of the Ferghana Valley relative to
Eurasia (discussed below) can account for ∼5 mm/yr of
nearly ∼25 mm/yr of north‐northwestward convergence of
the central Pamir with Eurasia, it appears that thrust faulting
at the northern margin of the Pamir absorbs at least 10 and
maybe 15 mm/yr of that ∼25 mm/yr of convergence between the Pamir and Eurasia. Such a rate is similar to the 13
± 4 mm/yr that Reigber et al. [2001] had inferred, and
consistent with triangulation measurements made farther
west [e.g., Guseva, 1986; Konopaltsev, 1971a, 1971b].
[26] Most, if not all, of this convergence between the
Pamir and Eurasia may be absorbed at the system of thrust
faults in the Alay Valley. The high level of seismicity in this
region attests to localized deformation (Figure 1), and evidence of thrust faulting in this region abounds [e.g.,
Coutand et al., 2002; Nikonov, 1974, 1975, 1977; Nikonov
et al., 1983; Strecker et al., 2003]. Arrowsmith and Strecker
[1999] measured a lower bound of 6 mm/yr for Holocene
convergence at one location near 39.5°N, 72.6°E. The GPS
measurements reported here suggest that localized convergence may be much more rapid than just 6 mm/yr, and
perhaps occurs by slip on more than one thrust, or reverse,
fault in this region. Obviously, with so few measurement
points we cannot eliminate north–south crustal shortening
within the Pamir as well, but both fault plane solutions of
earthquakes and evidence of active faulting imply a preponderance of normal faulting and east‐west extension
within the high axial portion of the Pamir [e.g., Burtman and
Molnar, 1993; Strecker et al., 1995]. Thus, we doubt that
reverse faulting and contraction at more than a couple of
mm/yr occurs in this region.
[27] This zone of thrust or reverse faulting along the
Trans‐Alay Range seems to mark a zone of intracontinental
subduction [e.g., Burtman and Molnar, 1993; Chatelain et
al., 1980; Hamburger et al., 1992], where the eastern continuation of the Tajik Depression has been subducted
southward beneath the Pamir. The suggestion of localized
deformation at the foot of the Trans‐Alay Range, therefore,
accords with this region being the surface manifestation of
such subduction.

TC6014

3.5. Rotation of the Ferghana Valley and Slip on the
Talas‐Ferghana Fault
[28] West of the segment of the Tien Shan that separates
the effectively rigid Tarim Basin from the Kazakh Platform
to the north, the high terrain of the Tien Shan west of the
Talas‐Ferghana fault splits into two belts that surround the
Ferghana Valley, which also seems to behave as a block that
deforms at most only slowly (Figures 2 and 8). With thick,
poorly consolidated sedimentary rock, the Ferghana Valley
offers poor sites for GPS points, and most sites have been
installed in sedimentary rock exposed in folds on the margins of the valley. Rates of movement relative to Eurasia
increase from low rates at sites in the southwestern part of
the basin to higher rates near its northeast margin, consistent
with rotation of the basin, with respect to Eurasia, about an
axis near its southwest end [e.g., Reigber et al., 2001;
Thomas et al., 1993]. Sites on the southeast side, however,
move faster toward Eurasia than those on the northwest side,
presumably because they lie within the deforming margins
of the Ferghana Valley. On the northwest margin, crustal
shortening occurs with a NW‐SE orientation, and on its
southern margin, north‐south shortening occurs. Field
observations, geophysical profiling, and fault plane solutions of earthquakes suggest that the east‐west trending
South Tien Shan, which is cored largely by Paleozoic
metamorphic rock, has been thrust atop the southern edge of
the Ferghana Valley [e.g., Burtman and Molnar, 1993;
Laverov and Makarov, 2005]. Thus, the counterclockwise
rotation of the Ferghana Valley converts roughly north‐
south movement of the South Tien Shan with respect to
Eurasia, into NW‐SE shortening across the Chatkal and
adjacent ranges that lie northwest of the valley. Using sites
on the margins of the Ferghana Valley and allowing uniform
strain among them, we estimate an angular velocity of the
valley with respect to Eurasia given by counterclockwise
rotation at −0.73° (±0.08°) Myr−1 about an axis of rotation
that is located just southwest of the valley at 39.9°N (±0.4),
67.5°E (±0.7) (Figure 8). To determine that angular velocity,
we used those points shown in Figure 8 with blue arrows
superimposed on them; the blue arrows show calculated
velocities for those points.
[29] The eastern end of the Ferghana Valley is bounded by
high terrain through which a clear right‐lateral strike‐slip
fault passes, the Talas‐Ferghana fault [e.g., Burtman, 1963,
1964, 1975]. From several upper bounds of ∼10 mm/yr for
the Holocene slip rate on the fault, Burtman et al. [1996]
suggested that the fault currently slips at that rate. By contrast, Trifonov et al. [1992] inferred that Late Quaternary
and Holocene right‐lateral slip along the fault was not uniform along the fault, and that the highest rate of about 15
mm/yr occurs in its central part just opposite the Ferghana
Valley. GPS data, however, including both analyses of a
subset of the data that we present here [e.g., Meade and
Hager, 2001; Zubovich et al., 2007] and of other, independent data [Mohadjer et al., 2010], showed that the rate
must be much lower, < ∼2 mm/yr. The modest differences in
velocities of sites on the two sides of the fault (Figures 8 and
9) demonstrate that the slip rate indeed is small, no more
than ∼1–2 mm/yr. Profiles of GPS velocities (Figure 9), in

rotates about an axis at 67.5°E ± 0.7°E, 39.9°N ± 0.4°N at a rate of −0.73° ± 0.08° Myr−1 with respect to
Eurasia. Error ellipses show 95% confidence regions.
fact, give little indication of any slip at all. Moreover, the
obliquity of the fault to the direction of movement of the
Ferghana Valley, relative to Eurasia, attest to a small component of convergence perpendicular to the fault, which
presumably manifests itself, at least in part, in the presence
of high terrain southwest of the fault.

4. Conclusions
[30] The GPS data presented here demonstrate that the
western part of the Tarim Basin converges with Eurasia at
20 ± 2 mm/yr (Figures 2 and 4, profiles A‐A′ and B‐B′),
where convergence between India and Eurasia is only
∼33 mm/yr [Argus et al., 2010]. At a convergence rate of
20 mm/yr the entire Tien Shan would have been built in less
than 10 Ma. Thus, these data suggest that following slow
initial growth, the Tien Shan did not develop into a major
mountain belt until late in the history of convergence between
India and Eurasia [Abdrakhmatov et al., 1996; Reigber et al.,
2001].
[31] Most of the convergence between the Tarim Basin
and the Kazakh Platform is absorbed within the Tien Shan,
presumably by slip on thrust or reverse faults; localized

zones of shortening at rates of ∼2 mm/yr to as many as
6 mm/yr lie within the Tien Shan. In addition, shortening at
∼1–3 mm/yr occurs north of the belt, within the Dzungarian
Alatau and its westward continuation, and possibly also in
the southern part of the Kazakh Platform. Moreover, the
movement of the Tarim Basin toward the Kazakh Platform
includes a left‐lateral strike‐slip component parallel to the
Tien Shan of ∼4 mm/yr in the eastern part of our network,
decreasing to only ∼2 mm/yr at the western end of the belt,
which we associate with clockwise rotation of the Tarim
Basin with respect to Eurasia.
[32] GPS data surrounding the Ferghana Valley corroborate the inference that this basin has rotated around an axis
southwest of the valley [Reigber et al., 2001; Thomas et al.,
1993], and refine the angular velocity of that motion
(Figure 8). Shortening across the Chatkal and parallel
mountain ranges that lie along the northwestern margin of
the valley occurs at ∼5 mm/yr. Slip on the Talas‐Ferghana
fault, at the eastern end of the Ferghana Valley, occurs at
<∼2 mm/yr (Figure 9) [Meade and Hager, 2001; Mohadjer
et al., 2010; Zubovich et al., 2007].

diamonds and red squares indicate approximately eastward components, and those for blue and green
triangles show movement to the right of the profiles, approximately southward. Error bars give 1s
uncertainties. Black diamonds and blue upward pointing triangles show rates for points within 75 km to
the north of profiles G‐G′ and H‐H′ in Figure 2, and red squares and green downward pointing triangles
show points within 75 km to the south of those profiles. Symbols showing strike‐slip faulting indicate the
position of the Talas‐Ferghana fault, as inferred from the detailed topography.

ZUBOVICH ET AL.: GPS VELOCITY FIELD FOR THE TIEN SHAN

and although it is not uniformly distributed, no single predominant fault absorbs the majority of this convergence. By
contrast, the Pamir seems to move northward toward Eurasia
with a large fraction absorbed near the Alay Valley, which
lies just north of the Trans‐Alay Range and bounds the
northern edge of the Pamir. The shortening rate in this zone
is at least 10 and perhaps 15 mm/yr, similar to what Reigber
et al. [2001] had inferred from fewer measurements.
Moreover, the northern part of the Pamir diverges westward
from the Tarim Basin at 5–8 mm/yr, a result consistent with
the presence of grabens in the eastern Pamir, with fault plane
solutions of earthquakes that demonstrate normal faulting
and east‐west extension, and with sparse continuous GPS
measurements [Mohadjer et al., 2010].

Appendix A: Processing of GPS Observations
[34] We analyzed the GPS data using the GAMIT/
GLOBK software [Herring, 2004; King and Bock, 2004]
with a three‐step approach [Dong et al., 1998, Herring et
al., 2002]. In the first step, for each day we used GPS
phase observations to estimate station coordinates and the
zenith delay of the atmosphere at each station that recorded
GPS signal that day, and parameters describing the orbits of
the satellites and the orientation of the Earth. To tie the
regional measurements to an external global reference frame
in the next steps, we included 8–12 continuously operating
IGS stations in the processing of data for each day [Dow et
al., 2009]. In the second step, we combined the regional
daily solutions from the first step with global GPS analysis
performed at Scripps Institution of Oceanography and saved
them into a single file, for each campaign, as loosely constrained solutions of site positions. The Scripps global
analysis contains over 300 stations and provides accurate
orbits and positions of these stations.
[35] In the third step, the combined loosely constrained
solutions for each campaign were passed through a Kalman
filter, GLOBK [Herring, 2004], to estimate a consistent set
of coordinates and velocities. Before we estimated velocities, however, we examined time series of positions obtained
in the two earlier steps to identify outliers and offsets or
“jumps.” We removed outlier position estimates from the
solution and covariance matrices used in the GLOBK Kalman filter analysis, and we accounted for offsets by allowing
independent position estimates before and after the time of

TC6014

the offset. We used random walk variances of 1–4 mm2/yr2
in the forward run of the GLOBK Kalman filter estimate site
velocities and “realistic” uncertainties. Except where indicated otherwise, we quote uncertainties as 1‐sigma estimates
(Table 1), but in Figures 3, 6, and 8 we show 95% confidence ellipses.
[36] We defined the reference frame for velocity estimates
in the third step, when we applied generalized constraints
[Dong et al., 1998] and estimated the six parameters (three
components of the rate of change of translation, three for
rotation) that tie that reference frame to a global frame. In
particular, we determined those six parameters by minimizing the horizontal velocities of 55 stable global IGS
stations with respect to the ITRF2005 NNR frame and the
rotated ITRF2005 EURA frame using the ITRF2005 angular
velocity [Altamimi et al., 2007; Herring et al., 2009]. The
weighted RMS fit of the horizontal velocities to the ITRF
2005 EURA frame using 52 global sites as reference sites
was 0.4 mm/yr. In Table 1, we present these velocities and
associated 1‐sigma standard deviations.
[37] Acknowledgments. Many people have contributed to the installation, maintenance, and measurement of the network, from its inception to
the latest measurements, but one person, Yuri A. Trapeznikov, played a
particularly important role before he died in 1999. A pioneer in GPS geodetic measurements in the former Soviet Union, he obtained permission to
install GPS points, created the facilities to record and analyze data, orchestrated ambitious field campaigns, helped design the “Russian” mark, and
made sure that the GPS network in the Kyrgyz and Kazakh Tien Shan became one of the best in the world. We also express special thanks to J. Klotz
for the design of the “German” mark and many CATS site installations.
